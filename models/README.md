## Context and Spatial Feature Calibration for Real-Time Semantic Segmentation




## Updates

- The code for our method will be open-sourced after review.
- We initially reproduced SFANet and MGSeg based on the original papers for a detailed comparison with them.
- We validate the validity of our reproductions, which achieve comparable performance to those in the original paper.
